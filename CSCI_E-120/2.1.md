### analyzing algorithms

Analyzing algorithms involves using empirical models to predict their performance based on real-world data and observations. Empirical analysis focuses on practical measurements and observations rather than theoretical predictions. In this approach, algorithms are implemented and run on specific inputs to gather performance data. The collected data is then used to create empirical models that help predict how the algorithm will perform under various conditions. This method provides valuable insights into the algorithm's behavior in real-world scenarios, helping developers make informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization.
