#### 1.1.4 Logical Equivalences

**Definition and Examples of Logical Equivalences:**
Logical equivalences express that two propositions have the same truth values under all circumstances.

```python
# Example: Logical Equivalence
# Propositions
p = True
q = False

# Logical Equivalence: De Morgan's Law
equivalence_demorgan = not (p and q) == (not p or not q)

# Display the result
print("De Morgan's Law:", equivalence_demorgan)
```

```
Output:

De Morgan's Law: True
This Python code demonstrates De Morgan's Law, a logical equivalence stating that the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations.

```
