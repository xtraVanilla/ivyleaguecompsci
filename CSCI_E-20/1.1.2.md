#### 1.1.2 Connectives and Propositions

**Explanation of Logical Connectives:**
Logical connectives (such as `and`, `or`, `not`) are used to combine propositions and form more complex statements. Let's explore their usage.

```python
# Example: Logical Connectives
# Propositions
p = True
q = False

# Logical Connective: AND
result_and = p and q

# Logical Connective: OR
result_or = p or q

# Logical Connective: NOT
result_not = not p

# Display the results
print("p AND q:", result_and)
print("p OR q:", result_or)
print("NOT p:", result_not)
```

```
Output:

p AND q: False
p OR q: True
NOT p: False

```

This Python code demonstrates the use of logical connectives (`and`, `or`, `not`) with propositions `p` and `q`.
