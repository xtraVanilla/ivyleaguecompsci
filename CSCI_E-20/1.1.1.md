#### 1.1.1 Inquiry Problems

**Introduction to Inquiry Problems:**
Inquiry problems involve posing questions and finding logical solutions. They are fundamental to formal logic, guiding the process of reasoning and decision-making.

```python
# Example: Inquiry Problem
# Question: Is it sunny and warm outside?
# Propositions
sunny = True
warm = True

# Logical Connective: AND
sunny_and_warm = sunny and warm

# Display the result
print("Is it sunny and warm outside?", sunny_and_warm)
```

```
Output:

Is it sunny and warm outside? True

```

This Python code illustrates an inquiry problem by checking if it's both sunny and warm outside. The logical connective `and` combines the truth values of the propositions (`sunny` and `warm`) to determine the overall result.
