#### 1.1.1 Inquiry Problems

**Introduction to Inquiry Problems:**
Inquiry problems involve posing questions and finding logical solutions. They are fundamental to formal logic, guiding the process of reasoning and decision-making.

**Example Python Code in Markdown:**

````python
```python
# Example: Inquiry Problem
# Question: Is it sunny and warm outside?
# Propositions
sunny = True
warm = True

# Logical Connective: AND
sunny_and_warm = sunny and warm

# Display the result
print("Is it sunny and warm outside?", sunny_and_warm)
````

```
Output:

Is it sunny and warm outside? True

```

This Python code illustrates an inquiry problem by checking if it's both sunny and warm outside. The logical connective `and` combines the truth values of the propositions (`sunny` and `warm`) to determine the overall result.

#### 1.1.2 Connectives and Propositions

**Explanation of Logical Connectives:**
Logical connectives (such as `and`, `or`, `not`) are used to combine propositions and form more complex statements. Let's explore their usage.

**Example Python Code in Markdown:**

```python
# Example: Logical Connectives
# Propositions
p = True
q = False

# Logical Connective: AND
result_and = p and q

# Logical Connective: OR
result_or = p or q

# Logical Connective: NOT
result_not = not p

# Display the results
print("p AND q:", result_and)
print("p OR q:", result_or)
print("NOT p:", result_not)
```

```
Output:

p AND q: False
p OR q: True
NOT p: False

```

This Python code demonstrates the use of logical connectives (`and`, `or`, `not`) with propositions `p` and `q`.

#### 1.1.3 Truth Tables

**Construction and Interpretation of Truth Tables:**
Truth tables provide a systematic way to evaluate the truth values of compound propositions for all possible combinations of truth values of their components.

**Example Python Code in Markdown:**

```python
# Example: Truth Table for AND
print("Truth Table for AND:")
print("| p | q | p AND q |")
print("|---|---|---------|")
for p in [True, False]:
    for q in [True, False]:
        result = p and q
        print(f"| {int(p)} | {int(q)} | {int(result)} |")
```

```
Output:

Truth Table for AND:
| p | q | p AND q |
|---|---|---------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

```

This Python code constructs a truth table for the logical connective `and`, evaluating all possible combinations of truth values for propositions `p` and `q`.

#### 1.1.4 Logical Equivalences

**Definition and Examples of Logical Equivalences:**
Logical equivalences express that two propositions have the same truth values under all circumstances.

**Example Python Code in Markdown:**

```python
# Example: Logical Equivalence
# Propositions
p = True
q = False

# Logical Equivalence: De Morgan's Law
equivalence_demorgan = not (p and q) == (not p or not q)

# Display the result
print("De Morgan's Law:", equivalence_demorgan)
```

```
Output:

De Morgan's Law: True
This Python code demonstrates De Morgan's Law, a logical equivalence stating that the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations.

```
