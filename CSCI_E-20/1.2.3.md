#### 1.2.3 Proof Sequences

**Understanding Proof Sequences:**
Proof sequences in propositional logic involve a series of logical steps that lead to the establishment of the truth value of a proposition. These sequences are fundamental in demonstrating the validity of logical arguments.

**Example Python Code:**

```python
# Example: Proof Sequence
# Propositions
p = True
q = False

# Proof Sequence: Modus Ponens
proof_result = (p and (p → q)) → q

# Display the result
print("Modus Ponens Result:", proof_result)

# Modus Ponens Result: False

```
