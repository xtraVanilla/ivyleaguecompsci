## 3.1.4 Handling Partial Failure Using the Circuit Breaker Pattern

The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used in microservices architectures to handle partial failures and prevent cascading failures. It is inspired by electrical circuits, where a circuit breaker can open to stop the flow of electricity when there is a fault, preventing damage to connected devices. Similarly, in a microservices context, the Circuit Breaker pattern helps to isolate failing services, allowing them to recover and avoiding the propagation of failures.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Closed State:**

   - In the closed state, the Circuit Breaker allows requests to pass through, monitoring their success and failure rates.

2. **Open State:**

   - When the failure rate surpasses a predefined threshold, the Circuit Breaker transitions to the open state. In this state, requests are blocked, and the Circuit Breaker avoids calling the failing service.

3. **Half-Open State:**
   - After a specified time, the Circuit Breaker enters the half-open state, allowing a limited number of requests to pass through. If these requests are successful, the Circuit Breaker transitions back to the closed state. Otherwise, it returns to the open state.

### Example Scenario:

Consider a scenario where a microservice A communicates with microservice B. The Circuit Breaker pattern is applied to the communication between A and B.

**1. Closed State:**

- The Circuit Breaker initially allows requests to flow from A to B without intervention.

**2. Open State:**

- If the failure rate of requests from A to B exceeds the threshold, the Circuit Breaker transitions to the open state. Requests from A to B are blocked to prevent further failures.

**3. Half-Open State:**

- After a cooldown period, the Circuit Breaker enters the half-open state. A limited number of test requests are sent to B. If these requests succeed, the Circuit Breaker transitions back to the closed state. Otherwise, it remains open.

**4. Continuous Monitoring:**

- The Circuit Breaker continues to monitor the health of the communication between A and B, dynamically adjusting its state based on the observed success and failure rates.

By using the Circuit Breaker pattern, microservices architectures can gracefully handle partial failures, improve resilience, and prevent the spread of failures across the system. This pattern is particularly valuable in distributed environments where services may experience intermittent issues.

Let's explore a TypeScript example of implementing the Circuit Breaker pattern using a library called 'opossum.' This library provides a straightforward way to introduce circuit breaking capabilities in a TypeScript application.

First, install the 'opossum' library using npm:

```bash
npm install opossum
```

Now, let's create a simple TypeScript class representing a service that communicates with another service and utilizes the Circuit Breaker pattern.

```typescript
import CircuitBreaker from "opossum";

class ServiceCommunicator {
  private circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker;

  constructor() {
    // Create a new Circuit Breaker with default options
    this.circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(this.callService);
  }

  // The method representing the service communication
  private callService(): Promise<string> {
    // Simulate an asynchronous service call
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Introduce some random failure for demonstration purposes
      const random = Math.random();
      if (random < 0.8) {
        resolve("Service response");
      } else {
        // Simulate a service failure
        reject(new Error("Service error"));
      }
    });
  }

  // Method to make a request using the Circuit Breaker
  public async makeRequest(): Promise<string> {
    try {
      // Use the Circuit Breaker to make the service call
      const result = await this.circuitBreaker.fire();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the error when the Circuit Breaker is open
      return "Fallback response";
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const serviceCommunicator = new ServiceCommunicator();

// Make multiple requests to demonstrate the Circuit Breaker in action
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  serviceCommunicator
    .makeRequest()
    .then((response) => console.log(`Request ${i}: ${response}`))
    .catch((error) => console.error(`Request ${i} failed: ${error.message}`));
}
```

In this example, the `ServiceCommunicator` class uses the 'opossum' library to create a Circuit Breaker. The `callService` method simulates a service call, with a random chance of failure. The `makeRequest` method is where the Circuit Breaker is invoked, and a fallback response is provided when the Circuit Breaker is open.

This TypeScript example illustrates a basic implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern using the 'opossum' library, allowing for graceful degradation in the face of service failures.

In a microservice architecture, the Circuit Breaker pattern is often applied to handle failures in communication between microservices. Let's consider an example where a TypeScript microservice uses a Circuit Breaker to communicate with another microservice. We'll use a simplified scenario of an order service communicating with a payment service.

Firstly, install the 'opossum' library using npm:

```bash
npm install opossum
```

Now, let's create a TypeScript class for the order service that incorporates a Circuit Breaker when making requests to the payment service.

```typescript
import CircuitBreaker from "opossum";

class OrderService {
  private paymentServiceCircuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker;

  constructor() {
    // Create a Circuit Breaker for the payment service communication
    this.paymentServiceCircuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(
      this.callPaymentService
    );
  }

  // Method representing the communication with the payment service
  private callPaymentService(orderId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Simulate an asynchronous payment service call
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Introduce some random failure for demonstration purposes
      const random = Math.random();
      if (random < 0.8) {
        resolve(`Payment successful for order ${orderId}`);
      } else {
        // Simulate a payment service failure
        reject(new Error(`Payment failed for order ${orderId}`));
      }
    });
  }

  // Method to place an order and handle payment communication with Circuit Breaker
  public async placeOrder(orderId: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
      // Use the Circuit Breaker to make the payment service call
      const paymentResult = await this.paymentServiceCircuitBreaker.fire(
        orderId
      );
      return `Order ${orderId} placed. ${paymentResult}`;
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the error when the Circuit Breaker is open
      return `Order ${orderId} placement failed. ${error.message}`;
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const orderService = new OrderService();

// Make multiple order placement requests to demonstrate the Circuit Breaker in action
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  orderService
    .placeOrder(`order-${i}`)
    .then((result) => console.log(result))
    .catch((error) =>
      console.error(`Order placement failed: ${error.message}`)
    );
}
```

In this example, the `OrderService` class has a Circuit Breaker specifically for communication with the payment service (`callPaymentService`). The `placeOrder` method uses the Circuit Breaker to handle the payment service communication. When the payment service encounters failures, the Circuit Breaker opens, and a fallback response is provided.

This demonstrates how the Circuit Breaker pattern can be integrated into a microservice to enhance resilience in communication with other services.
