### 3rd Party Registration

In the 3rd Party Registration pattern of Service Discovery, external entities or services register themselves with a third-party service registry. This allows services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other without direct knowledge of their locations. For example, a microservice might register its availability, and other services can query the third-party registry to locate and interact with that service. This pattern enhances flexibility and decouples services, enabling easier updates and scaling in dynamic environments.

Here's a simplified TypeScript example illustrating the 3rd Party Registration pattern for Service Discovery:

```typescript
// Third-party service registry
class ServiceRegistry {
  private services: Map<string, string[]> = new Map();

  // Register a service with the registry
  registerService(serviceName: string, endpoints: string[]) {
    this.services.set(serviceName, endpoints);
  }

  // Discover endpoints for a given service
  discoverService(serviceName: string): string[] | undefined {
    return this.services.get(serviceName);
  }
}

// Example microservice using 3rd Party Registration
class Microservice {
  constructor(private serviceName: string, private registry: ServiceRegistry) {}

  // Register the microservice with the registry
  register() {
    const endpoints = [`http://localhost:${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)}`];
    this.registry.registerService(this.serviceName, endpoints);
  }

  // Discover other services using the registry
  discoverService(serviceName: string): string[] | undefined {
    return this.registry.discoverService(serviceName);
  }
}

// Example usage
const registry = new ServiceRegistry();

const serviceA = new Microservice("ServiceA", registry);
serviceA.register();

const serviceB = new Microservice("ServiceB", registry);
serviceB.register();

// Microservice A discovering endpoints for ServiceB
const discoveredEndpoints = serviceA.discoverService("ServiceB");
console.log(`Discovered endpoints for ServiceB:`, discoveredEndpoints);
```

In this example, `ServiceRegistry` acts as the third-party registry, and `Microservice` instances register themselves with the registry. The `discoverService` method allows a microservice to find endpoints for a given service.
