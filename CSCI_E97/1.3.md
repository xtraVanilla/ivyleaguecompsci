### load balancing

In pool architecture, each client is allocated its dedicated monolith, allowing for tailored scaling based on individual needs. To ensure efficient distribution of requests and optimize resource utilization, load balancing becomes a critical component. A load balancer sits in front of the dedicated instances for each client, distributing incoming requests across them based on various algorithms, such as round-robin or least connections. This not only prevents a single client from monopolizing resources but also enhances system reliability and responsiveness. An example of a load balancer commonly used in pool architecture is NGINX, which efficiently distributes incoming traffic to the respective client's dedicated infrastructure, contributing to a balanced and performant system.

This combination of pool architecture and load balancing provides a scalable and client-focused approach, allowing for fine-grained control over resource allocation and ensuring each client receives optimal service without impacting others.
