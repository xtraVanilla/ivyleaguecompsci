### Transactional Outbox

In the Transactional Outbox pattern, the system uses an outbox table to store messages that need to be sent as part of a transaction. These messages are later processed by an external message broker. The outbox table is part of the same database transaction, ensuring that both the business data and the messages are committed atomically. After the transaction is successfully committed, an external process picks up the messages from the outbox table and sends them to the message broker.

This pattern ensures consistency between the application's state and the messages sent, making it a suitable choice for systems that require strong transactional guarantees. The key idea is to decouple the message-sending process from the application's transaction, reducing the risk of inconsistencies between the data store and the messaging system.

Here's a simplified TypeScript example illustrating the Transactional Outbox pattern. This example uses a fictional e-commerce scenario where an order creation triggers an email notification:

```typescript
import * as db from "your-database-library";
import * as messageBroker from "your-message-broker-library";

class OrderService {
  async createOrder(orderData: Order): Promise<void> {
    // Begin a database transaction
    await db.beginTransaction();

    try {
      // Save the order details in the database
      const orderId = await db.createOrder(orderData);

      // Add a message to the outbox table
      await db.addToOutboxTable({
        orderId,
        messageType: "OrderCreated",
        payload: { orderId, customerEmail: orderData.customerEmail },
      });

      // Commit the transaction (includes order creation and outbox message)
      await db.commitTransaction();
    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback the transaction if an error occurs
      await db.rollbackTransaction();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// External process to send messages from the outbox table to the message broker
async function processOutboxMessages(): Promise<void> {
  const outboxMessages = await db.getOutboxMessages();

  for (const message of outboxMessages) {
    // Send the message to the message broker
    await messageBroker.sendMessage(message);

    // Mark the message as processed in the outbox table
    await db.markOutboxMessageAsProcessed(message.id);
  }
}

// Usage example
const orderService = new OrderService();

// Create a new order (triggers outbox message creation)
orderService.createOrder({
  orderId: "123",
  customerEmail: "customer@example.com",
  // other order details...
});

// Process outbox messages asynchronously
processOutboxMessages();
```

In this example, the `OrderService` class encapsulates the logic for creating an order. The `createOrder` method begins a database transaction, saves the order details, adds a message to the outbox table, and then commits the transaction. The external process (`processOutboxMessages`) is responsible for periodically fetching messages from the outbox table and sending them to the message broker. This separation ensures that the messages are sent reliably and independently of the main transaction.
