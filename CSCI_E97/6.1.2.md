### command query responsibility segregration

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that separates the responsibility of handling command operations (updates) from query operations (reads) in a system. Below is a TypeScript example illustrating CQRS:

Let's consider a simple scenario with a hypothetical e-commerce system where we want to add a new product using CQRS.

First, we define commands for adding a product:

```typescript
// commands.ts
export class AddProductCommand {
  constructor(
    public productId: string,
    public name: string,
    public price: number
  ) {}
}
```

Next, we have the command handler responsible for processing the command:

```typescript
// commandHandler.ts
import { AddProductCommand } from "./commands";

export class ProductCommandHandler {
  handle(command: AddProductCommand): void {
    // Logic for adding a new product goes here
    console.log(`Product added: ${command.name}`);
  }
}
```

Now, let's define a read model for querying product information:

```typescript
// readModel.ts
export class ProductReadModel {
  private products: Record<string, { name: string; price: number }> = {};

  getProduct(productId: string): { name: string; price: number } | undefined {
    return this.products[productId];
  }

  getAllProducts(): Record<string, { name: string; price: number }> {
    return this.products;
  }

  updateProduct(productId: string, name: string, price: number): void {
    // Update the read model when a product is added or modified
    this.products[productId] = { name, price };
  }
}
```

Now, the application code that uses these components:

```typescript
// app.ts
import { AddProductCommand } from "./commands";
import { ProductCommandHandler } from "./commandHandler";
import { ProductReadModel } from "./readModel";

// Instantiate command handler and read model
const commandHandler = new ProductCommandHandler();
const readModel = new ProductReadModel();

// Simulate adding a new product using a command
const addProductCommand = new AddProductCommand("123", "Laptop", 999);
commandHandler.handle(addProductCommand);

// Query the read model to get product information
const laptopInfo = readModel.getProduct("123");
console.log("Product Info:", laptopInfo);
```

In this example:

- The `AddProductCommand` represents the intention to add a new product and includes necessary details like product ID, name, and price.
- The `ProductCommandHandler` processes the command and performs the necessary actions (in this case, logging the addition of a product).
- The `ProductReadModel` represents the read side, storing information about products. It provides methods for querying product information.
- The application code demonstrates how a command is handled and how the read model is queried to retrieve product information.

CQRS is particularly useful in scenarios where the read and write concerns of a system differ significantly, allowing for more tailored designs on each side. Keep in mind that implementing CQRS introduces complexity and should be justified by specific system requirements.
