### mitigating anomalies

Mitigating anomalies like lost updates, dirty re-reads, and fuzzy/non-repeatable reads in a distributed system involves implementing appropriate strategies. In the context of our OrderSaga example, we can enhance the saga to address these concerns:

1. **Lost Updates:**

   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a mechanism to detect and handle conflicts when multiple services attempt to update the same data concurrently.
   - **OrderSaga Enhancement:** Introduce a versioning mechanism for order-related data. When updating order details, check the version to ensure that updates are applied to the latest version only.

2. **Dirty Re-Reads:**

   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Use transaction isolation levels or optimistic locking to prevent transactions from reading uncommitted or "dirty" data.
   - **OrderSaga Enhancement:** Specify an appropriate isolation level when interacting with the OrderService and external services. Ensure that reads are consistent and do not reflect uncommitted changes.

3. **Fuzzy/Non-Repeatable Reads:**

   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Employ techniques like snapshot isolation or carefully manage the order of operations to reduce the likelihood of inconsistent reads.
   - **OrderSaga Enhancement:** Design the saga steps to minimize the time window between reads and updates. Consider using commutative updates or semantic locks to provide consistency guarantees.

Let's modify the OrderSaga class to incorporate these enhancements:

```typescript
// order.saga.ts

import { OrderService } from "./services/order.service";
import { RabbitMQService } from "./rabbitmq/rabbitmq.service";

export class OrderSaga {
  private orderService: OrderService;
  private rabbitMQService: RabbitMQService;

  constructor(orderService: OrderService, rabbitMQService: RabbitMQService) {
    this.orderService = orderService;
    this.rabbitMQService = rabbitMQService;
  }

  async execute(orderDetails: any) {
    try {
      // Read product details with appropriate isolation level
      const productDetails = await this.orderService.getProductDetails(
        orderDetails.productId
      );

      // Perform business logic and update order details with version check
      const updatedOrder = await this.orderService.updateOrder(
        orderDetails.orderId,
        productDetails,
        orderDetails.version
      );

      // Publish order created event
      await this.rabbitMQService.publishOrderCreatedEvent(updatedOrder);

      // Perform other steps of the saga
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors and initiate compensating actions
      await this.handleSagaError(error);
    }
  }

  private async handleSagaError(error: any) {
    // Implement error handling and compensating actions
    // This could involve rolling back changes, notifying other services, etc.
  }
}
```

In this enhanced version, we've introduced the concept of versioning (`orderDetails.version`) when updating order details. Additionally, consider adjusting the isolation level when reading product details to prevent dirty re-reads. These modifications contribute to a more robust handling of anomalies in a distributed system.

In a relational database, adjusting the isolation level is a way to control the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other transactions. Different isolation levels provide different trade-offs between consistency and performance. The specific steps to adjust the isolation level depend on the database system you're using.

Here's a general guide on adjusting isolation levels using TypeScript and a relational database like PostgreSQL as an example. Please adapt the steps based on the database you're working with:

Assuming you're using a library like TypeORM or another ORM that supports setting isolation levels, you can typically do something like this:

1. **Check ORM Documentation:**

   - Refer to the documentation of your ORM library to see if it provides support for setting isolation levels. For example, in TypeORM, you can check the [TypeORM documentation](https://typeorm.io/) for details.

2. **Set Isolation Level in Database Connection Configuration:**

   - When establishing a connection to the database, there should be a configuration object or file. Look for an option related to isolation level.

   Example with TypeORM:

   ```typescript
   // Assuming you have a TypeORM connection configuration
   const connectionOptions: ConnectionOptions = {
     // other configuration options...
     type: "postgres",
     host: "localhost",
     port: 5432,
     username: "your_username",
     password: "your_password",
     database: "your_database",
     synchronize: true,
     logging: true,
     entities: [
       /* your entity classes here */
     ],
     isolation: "READ COMMITTED", // Adjust this line according to your needs
   };
   ```

   In this example, `'READ COMMITTED'` is the isolation level. You can change it to a different level based on your requirements.

3. **Adjust Isolation Level for Specific Queries (Optional):**

   - Some ORMs also allow you to specify the isolation level for specific queries. Check your ORM's documentation for details.

   Example with TypeORM:

   ```typescript
   const productDetails = await this.orderService
     .createQueryBuilder("product")
     .setIsolationLevel("READ COMMITTED") // Adjust this line according to your needs
     .where("product.id = :productId", { productId: orderDetails.productId })
     .getOne();
   ```

   Here, `setIsolationLevel` is used to set the isolation level for the specific query.

Remember that the actual SQL statements generated by your ORM may vary, and the availability of certain features depends on the database system you're using. Always refer to the documentation of your specific database and ORM for accurate and detailed information.

A possible solution for point 3 involves adjusting the isolation level for specific queries. This can be achieved by setting the isolation level for individual transactions in your TypeScript code.

Assuming you are using a library like TypeORM, you can adjust the isolation level for specific queries like this:

1. **Check ORM Documentation:**

   - Refer to the documentation of your ORM library to see if it provides support for setting isolation levels for specific transactions or queries.

2. **Set Isolation Level for Specific Query:**

   - If your ORM supports it, you can set the isolation level for a specific query or transaction.

   Example with TypeORM:

   ```typescript
   // Assuming you have a TypeORM repository
   const productRepository = getRepository(Product);

   // Start a new transaction with a specific isolation level
   await getManager().transaction(
     "READ COMMITTED",
     async (transactionalEntityManager) => {
       // Now, perform your query or updates within this transaction
       const productDetails = await transactionalEntityManager.findOne(
         Product,
         {
           where: { id: productId },
         }
       );

       // Other operations within the transaction...

       // If everything is successful, commit the transaction
     }
   );
   ```

   In this example, the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level is set for the specific transaction.

3. **Review Database Compatibility:**

   - Ensure that the chosen isolation level is supported by your database system. Not all databases support all isolation levels, so it's crucial to check the compatibility.

   Example with PostgreSQL:

   PostgreSQL supports different isolation levels like `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, etc. Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html) for details.

Remember, the syntax and capabilities might vary based on your specific ORM and database. Always refer to the documentation of your ORM and database to ensure accurate and compatible usage.

Snapshot isolation is a powerful technique to address issues like fuzzy/non-repeatable reads. Let's explore how you can configure snapshot isolation in the context of TypeScript and databases.

Assuming you're using an ORM like TypeORM and a database that supports snapshot isolation (e.g., PostgreSQL or some other databases), here's a general guide:

1. **Database Configuration:**

   - Ensure that your database supports snapshot isolation. For PostgreSQL, you can enable it in the `postgresql.conf` configuration file:

     ```conf
     default_transaction_isolation = 'repeatable read'
     ```

2. **ORM Configuration:**

   - Configure your ORM to use the desired isolation level. This might vary based on the ORM you're using.

     Example with TypeORM in your `ormconfig.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "postgres",
       "host": "localhost",
       "port": 5432,
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password",
       "database": "your_database",
       "synchronize": true,
       "logging": true,
       "entities": ["src/entities/*.ts"],
       "migrations": ["src/migrations/*.ts"],
       "subscribers": ["src/subscribers/*.ts"],
       "cli": {
         "entitiesDir": "src/entities",
         "migrationsDir": "src/migrations",
         "subscribersDir": "src/subscribers"
       },
       "extra": {
         "transactionIsolation": "REPEATABLE READ"
       }
     }
     ```

   Ensure that the `transactionIsolation` property is set to your desired isolation level (`REPEATABLE READ` for snapshot isolation).

3. **Usage in TypeScript:**

   - When performing transactions or queries that require snapshot isolation, make sure to explicitly set the isolation level:

     ```typescript
     import { getManager } from "typeorm";

     // ...

     await getManager().transaction(
       "REPEATABLE READ",
       async (transactionalEntityManager) => {
         // Your operations within the transaction
       }
     );
     ```

This configuration ensures that the ORM uses snapshot isolation when interacting with the database.

Remember, the exact steps might vary based on your ORM and database. Always refer to the documentation of your specific tools for accurate and up-to-date information.
