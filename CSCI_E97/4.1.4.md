### communication between services

In microservices and the Saga pattern, services talk through a message broker, like RabbitMQ or Kafka. This broker acts as a go-between, letting services share info without being glued together. This asynchronous chat style keeps things flexible and tough—it's like letting services grow up on their own.

Pick your flavor of message broker, toss events or messages into the mix, and watch the services that care pick them up. Loose connections, big resilience—that's the game.

For Sagas, one service might shout, 'Step done!' Others tune in, moving forward or doing cleanup if things flop. It's like a chat room for services, keeping the whole system in sync without the drama of everyone talking at once. That's the secret sauce behind Sagas and their dance with distributed transactions, making sure the system stays on its toes.
