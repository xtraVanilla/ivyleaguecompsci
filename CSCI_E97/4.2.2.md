### anomalies

In a distributed system, anomalies such as lost updates, dirty re-reads, and fuzzy/non-repeatable reads can occur due to the inherent challenges of maintaining consistency across multiple services and databases. Let's briefly define each of these anomalies:

1. **Lost Updates:**

   - **Definition:** Lost updates occur when multiple transactions attempt to update the same piece of data concurrently, but only one of them succeeds, causing the changes from the other transactions to be lost.
   - **Cause:** This can happen in a distributed environment where concurrent transactions are updating shared data, and the coordination mechanism fails to ensure proper synchronization.

2. **Dirty Re-Reads:**

   - **Definition:** Dirty re-reads happen when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another uncommitted transaction. The reading transaction sees temporary or "dirty" data that might be rolled back later.
   - **Cause:** Lack of isolation between transactions or the absence of proper synchronization mechanisms can lead to dirty re-reads.

3. **Fuzzy/Non-Repeatable Reads:**
   - **Definition:** Fuzzy or non-repeatable reads occur when a transaction reads the same data multiple times but gets different results each time. This inconsistency arises due to concurrent modifications by other transactions.
   - **Cause:** In a distributed system, if there is no mechanism to lock or isolate data during reads, another transaction might modify the data between consecutive reads, leading to fuzzy reads.

To address these anomalies, distributed systems often implement various strategies such as isolation levels, optimistic or pessimistic locking, and versioning. These strategies aim to provide a balance between consistency and performance.

In the context of the OrderSaga implementation, re-reading product details and employing suitable locking mechanisms, like semantic locks or commutative updates, can help mitigate these anomalies. Additionally, by carefully designing the interactions between services and considering the ordering of operations, it's possible to minimize the occurrence of these anomalies and maintain a more consistent system state.
