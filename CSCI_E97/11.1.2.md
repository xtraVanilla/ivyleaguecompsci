### audit logging

The Audit Logging pattern is a crucial aspect of observability that involves capturing and recording relevant information about system activities for auditing and compliance purposes. This pattern helps in maintaining a detailed record of actions and events, allowing administrators to trace user actions, detect security incidents, and ensure regulatory compliance.

Audit logs typically include information such as who performed the action, what action was taken, when it occurred, and additional context relevant to the event. These logs are often stored securely and can be used for various purposes, including troubleshooting, forensic analysis, and meeting compliance requirements.

### TypeScript Example:

Let's create a simple TypeScript example that demonstrates audit logging for a hypothetical user authentication system:

```typescript
// AuditLogger.ts

export class AuditLogger {
  static logAuthenticationAttempt(username: string, success: boolean): void {
    // In a real-world scenario, you would persist this log to a secure storage.
    console.log(
      `Audit Log: User ${username} attempted authentication. Success: ${success}`
    );
  }
}
```

Now, let's use this audit logger in our authentication system:

```typescript
// AuthenticationSystem.ts

import { AuditLogger } from "./AuditLogger";

class AuthenticationSystem {
  authenticateUser(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    // Simulate authentication logic
    const success = username === "demo" && password === "password";

    // Log the authentication attempt
    AuditLogger.logAuthenticationAttempt(username, success);

    return success;
  }
}

// Example usage
const authSystem = new AuthenticationSystem();
const authenticationResult = authSystem.authenticateUser("demo", "password");

console.log(
  `Authentication Result: ${authenticationResult ? "Success" : "Failure"}`
);
```

In this example, the `AuditLogger` logs authentication attempts, indicating whether the attempt was successful or not. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the `console.log` statements with appropriate mechanisms to persist logs securely and integrate with centralized log management systems.

The Audit Logging pattern is especially important in environments where traceability, accountability, and compliance with regulations (such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) are critical requirements.
