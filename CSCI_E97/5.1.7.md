### event sourcing

Event Sourcing is a design pattern that involves capturing and storing every state change of an application as a sequence of events. Each event represents a change in the system's state and is stored in an event log. The current state of the system can be reconstructed by replaying these events. Here's a TypeScript example illustrating the Event Sourcing pattern:

```typescript
// Define an Event: ProductAddedToCart
class ProductAddedToCart {
  constructor(public productId: string, public quantity: number) {}
}

// Define an Aggregate: ShoppingCart
class ShoppingCart {
  private items: Map<string, number> = new Map();

  // Apply an event to update the state
  applyEvent(event: ProductAddedToCart): void {
    if (this.items.has(event.productId)) {
      this.items.set(
        event.productId,
        this.items.get(event.productId)! + event.quantity
      );
    } else {
      this.items.set(event.productId, event.quantity);
    }
  }

  // Get the current state
  getState(): Map<string, number> {
    return new Map(this.items);
  }
}

// Define an Event Store
class EventStore {
  private events: any[] = [];

  // Append an event to the event log
  appendEvent(event: any): void {
    this.events.push(event);
  }

  // Get all events for a specific aggregate
  getEventsForAggregate(aggregateId: string): any[] {
    return this.events.filter((event) => event.aggregateId === aggregateId);
  }
}

// Use Case: Adding products to a shopping cart using Event Sourcing

// Create instances
const eventStore = new EventStore();
const shoppingCart = new ShoppingCart();

// Apply events to the shopping cart
const productAddedEvent1 = new ProductAddedToCart("1", 2);
shoppingCart.applyEvent(productAddedEvent1);
eventStore.appendEvent({ aggregateId: "user123", ...productAddedEvent1 });

const productAddedEvent2 = new ProductAddedToCart("2", 1);
shoppingCart.applyEvent(productAddedEvent2);
eventStore.appendEvent({ aggregateId: "user123", ...productAddedEvent2 });

// Retrieve events for the aggregate from the event store
const eventsForUser123 = eventStore.getEventsForAggregate("user123");

// Replay events to reconstruct the aggregate's state
const reconstructedCart = new ShoppingCart();
for (const event of eventsForUser123) {
  reconstructedCart.applyEvent(event);
}

// Display the current state of the reconstructed shopping cart
console.log("Reconstructed Shopping Cart State:", reconstructedCart.getState());
```

In this example:

- `ProductAddedToCart` is an event representing the addition of a product to a shopping cart.
- `ShoppingCart` is an aggregate that applies events to update its state.
- `EventStore` is responsible for storing events in an event log and retrieving events for a specific aggregate.
- The use case involves adding products to a shopping cart, storing the events in the event store, retrieving events, and replaying them to reconstruct the shopping cart's state.

This example demonstrates the principles of Event Sourcing, where events are used to capture state changes, and the system's current state can be reconstructed by replaying these events.
