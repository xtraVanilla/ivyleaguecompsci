### Transaction Log Tailing

In the Transactional Messaging Patterns, Transaction Log Tailing is a technique where a system monitors the transaction log of a source database to capture and process changes in near real-time. This pattern is often employed in scenarios where maintaining consistency and tracking changes across distributed systems is crucial.

Here's a TypeScript example to illustrate the concept:

```typescript
// Transaction Log Tailer Class
class TransactionLogTailer {
  constructor(
    private sourceDatabase: SourceDatabase,
    private messageQueue: MessageQueue
  ) {}

  // Start tailing the transaction log
  public startTailing(): void {
    this.sourceDatabase.subscribeToTransactionLog(this.processTransaction);
  }

  // Process a transaction from the log
  private processTransaction(transaction: Transaction): void {
    // Process the transaction and publish relevant information to the message queue
    const updates = extractUpdatesFromTransaction(transaction);
    updates.forEach((update) => {
      this.messageQueue.publish(update);
    });
  }
}

// Example Usage
const sourceDatabase = new SourceDatabase();
const messageQueue = new MessageQueue();
const logTailer = new TransactionLogTailer(sourceDatabase, messageQueue);

// Start tailing the transaction log
logTailer.startTailing();
```

In this example:

- The `TransactionLogTailer` class is responsible for monitoring the transaction log of the `SourceDatabase`.
- The `startTailing` method initiates the tailing process by subscribing to the transaction log.
- The `processTransaction` method is called whenever a new transaction is recorded in the log. It extracts relevant updates and publishes them to the message queue.

Note: This example assumes the existence of a hypothetical `SourceDatabase` and `MessageQueue` classes, and you would need to adapt it to the specifics of your application and database system. Additionally, the `extractUpdatesFromTransaction` function needs to be implemented based on the structure of your transaction log.
