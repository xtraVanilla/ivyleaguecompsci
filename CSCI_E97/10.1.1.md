### externalized configuration

The Externalized Configuration pattern is a cross-cutting concern pattern that involves separating configuration settings from the application code and storing them in external configuration files or services. This pattern aims to enhance flexibility, maintainability, and security by allowing configurations to be modified without changing the code. Here's an explanation and a TypeScript example:

### Externalized Configuration Pattern:

In a microservices architecture, different services may have various configuration settings such as database connections, API endpoints, and feature toggles. The Externalized Configuration pattern involves externalizing these settings from the codebase, making them easily modifiable without requiring code changes.

### TypeScript Example:

Let's consider a simple TypeScript application with an externalized configuration. We'll use a configuration file in JSON format:

```typescript
// config.json

{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "secretpassword"
  },
  "api": {
    "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
    "apiKey": "api_key_123"
  },
  "featureToggles": {
    "newFeature": true,
    "experimentalFeature": false
  }
}
```

Now, let's create a service that uses these configurations:

```typescript
// AppService.ts

import * as fs from 'fs';

export class AppService {
  private config: any;

  constructor(configFilePath: string) {
    // Load external configuration from the file
    this.config = this.loadConfig(configFilePath);
  }

  // Example method using configurations
  fetchDataFromApi(path: string): string {
    const apiUrl = `${this.config.api.baseUrl}/${path}?apiKey=${this.config.api.apiKey}`;
    // In a real-world scenario, this method would make an HTTP request to the API.
    // For simplicity, we'll just return the constructed URL here.
    return apiUrl;
  }

  private loadConfig(configFilePath: string): any {
    try {
      // Read the configuration file
      const configFileContent = fs.readFileSync
```
