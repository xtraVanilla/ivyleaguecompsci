### decomposition by business capability pattern

The "Decompose by Business Capability Pattern" is a strategy in microservices architecture where you break down a system into services based on distinct business capabilities. Each service is designed to represent a specific business function or capability, making it more aligned with the organization's structure and goals. This approach enables better separation of concerns and allows teams to focus on specific business capabilities independently.

By decomposing based on business capabilities, organizations can create a microservices architecture that aligns closely with the functional aspects of their business, promoting agility and efficient development.

Let's consider an example of decomposing a fictional e-commerce system based on business capabilities. The project structure might look like this:

```plaintext
ecommerce-system/
|-- src/
|   |-- order-service/
|   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |-- services/
|   |   |-- models/
|   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |-- order-service.ts
|   |
|   |-- inventory-service/
|   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |-- services/
|   |   |-- models/
|   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |-- inventory-service.ts
|   |
|   |-- payment-service/
|   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |-- services/
|   |   |-- models/
|   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |-- payment-service.ts
|
|-- shared/
|   |-- common-utils/
|   |-- models/
|   |-- repositories/
|
|-- tests/
|-- config/
|-- scripts/
|-- dist/
|-- node_modules/
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- README.md
```

In this example:

- Each major business capability (order management, inventory management, payment processing) is represented by a separate service (`order-service`, `inventory-service`, `payment-service`).
- Each service has its own set of controllers, services, models, and repositories, encapsulating functionality related to that business capability.
- Shared code, such as common utilities, models, and repositories, is placed in the `shared` directory to be reused by multiple services.
- The `tests`, `config`, `scripts`, `dist`, and `node_modules` directories are standard for testing, configuration, build scripts, compiled code, and third-party dependencies, respectively.
- The `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `README.md` files are essential for project configuration, TypeScript settings, and documentation.

This structure fosters independence in development, allowing teams to focus on specific business capabilities. Communication between services is facilitated through well-defined APIs, and changes to one capability do not necessarily affect others. The structure also provides flexibility for scaling and adapting to changes in business requirements.
