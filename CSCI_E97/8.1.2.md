### consumer-side contract test

Consumer-Side Contract Testing is a testing pattern where the consumer of a service defines and executes tests to ensure that its expectations regarding the behavior of the service provider are met. This helps in early detection of issues and ensures that changes made by the provider do not break the expectations of the consumer. Here's an example of Consumer-Side Contract Testing using TypeScript and a testing library like Jest:

### Consumer Side:

```typescript
// Consumer contract test
import { pactWith } from "jest-pact";
import { like } from "@pact-foundation/pact/dsl/matchers";
import { getPerson } from "./consumer";

pactWith({ consumer: "Consumer", provider: "Provider" }, (provider) => {
  it("should successfully get a person", async () => {
    await provider
      .uponReceiving("a request to get a person")
      .withRequest({
        method: "GET",
        path: "/person/123",
      })
      .willRespondWith({
        status: 200,
        body: like({
          id: "123",
          name: "John Doe",
          age: 30,
        }),
      });

    await expect(getPerson("123")).resolves.toStrictEqual({
      id: "123",
      name: "John Doe",
      age: 30,
    });
  });
});
```

In this example, the `pactWith` function from the `jest-pact` library is used to define a contract test. The consumer specifies the expected request and response using the Pact DSL (Domain Specific Language). The `getPerson` function is then tested against these expectations.

When this test is run, the `jest-pact` library will generate a Pact contract file based on the defined expectations. This file can later be used by the provider for verification.

This consumer-side contract test ensures that the consumer and provider are in agreement about the expected interactions. If the provider makes any breaking changes, the consumer-side tests will fail, providing early feedback to the consumer team.

Note: The examples provided here use the Jest testing framework along with the `jest-pact` library for simplicity. There are other tools and libraries available for consumer-side contract testing in different ecosystems.
