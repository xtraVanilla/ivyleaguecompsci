### health check API

The Health Check API pattern is a fundamental component of observability in microservices architecture. It involves the implementation of an endpoint or API that provides information about the health and status of a microservice. This pattern is crucial for monitoring the overall well-being of microservices, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues.

### Health Check API Pattern:

1. **Endpoint Implementation:**

   - Microservices expose an endpoint (e.g., `/health`) that serves as the health check API.
   - The endpoint returns information about the service's health status, typically in a standardized format like JSON.

2. **Health Status Indicators:**

   - The response from the health check API includes indicators such as "up" or "down" to signify the service's overall health.
   - Additional details, such as database connectivity, external dependencies, and resource utilization, can be included.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Monitoring tools or orchestrators routinely invoke the health check API to assess the health of microservices.
   - The frequency of health checks can be configured based on the system's requirements.

### TypeScript Example:

Let's create a simple TypeScript example illustrating the Health Check API pattern:

```typescript
// HealthCheckService.ts

export class HealthCheckService {
  private isDatabaseConnected: boolean = true;

  getHealthStatus(): { status: string; details: Record<string, any> } {
    // Simulate database connectivity check
    const databaseStatus = this.isDatabaseConnected
      ? "connected"
      : "disconnected";

    return {
      status: this.isServiceUp() ? "up" : "down",
      details: {
        database: databaseStatus,
        memoryUsage: process.memoryUsage(),
        customDetails: "Additional details can be added here",
      },
    };
  }

  private isServiceUp(): boolean {
    // Add more complex health checks as needed
    return this.isDatabaseConnected;
  }
}

// Express Server with Health Check API

import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import { HealthCheckService } from "./HealthCheckService";

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const healthCheckService = new HealthCheckService();

// Health check endpoint
app.get("/health", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const healthStatus = healthCheckService.getHealthStatus();
  res.json(healthStatus);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, the `HealthCheckService` class encapsulates the logic for determining the health status of the microservice. The Express server exposes a `/health` endpoint that returns the health status, including details like database connectivity and memory usage.

Regularly invoking the `/health` endpoint allows external tools or orchestrators to monitor the microservice's health. This proactive approach aids in identifying potential issues early and maintaining the overall stability of the microservices architecture.
