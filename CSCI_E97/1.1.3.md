### example

Implementing a pool architecture involves structuring the project to accommodate dedicated monolithic instances for each client. Here's a simplified guide to set up the project directory:

1. **Create a Monolith Template:**
   - Start with a generic monolith template that represents the core functionality of your application.

```plaintext
|-- monolith-template/
   |-- src/
      |-- controllers/
      |-- services/
      |-- models/
      |-- config/
      |-- ...
   |-- tests/
   |-- config/
   |-- scripts/
   |-- .gitignore
   |-- package.json
   |-- tsconfig.json
   |-- README.md
```

2. **Duplicate for Each Client:**
   - Create a copy of the monolith template for each client.

```plaintext
|-- clients/
   |-- client1/
      |-- src/
      |-- tests/
      |-- config/
      |-- scripts/
      |-- .gitignore
      |-- package.json
      |-- tsconfig.json
      |-- README.md
   |-- client2/
      |-- ...
```

3. **Client-Specific Configuration:**

   - Adjust configuration files in each client's instance to customize settings (e.g., client-specific environment variables).

4. **Shared Codebase:**

   - Ensure that the core codebase remains shared among all clients. Avoid client-specific modifications in the code to maintain a uniform codebase.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

   - Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform to manage and deploy the infrastructure for each client.

6. **Deployment Scripts:**

   - Create scripts for deploying each client's monolithic instance independently.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**

   - Set up monitoring and logging systems, considering that logs and metrics will be distributed across multiple client instances.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for maintaining, deploying, and updating each client instance.

This structure allows you to scale and customize infrastructure for each client while maintaining a shared codebase. Keep in mind the considerations mentioned in the previous content, such as potential challenges in maintenance and monitoring.
