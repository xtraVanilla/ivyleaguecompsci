### REST

## 3.2.1 REST - Example

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications. In a microservices context, RESTful communication is often implemented through HTTP, leveraging standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. Below is a simplified example illustrating how two microservices, a Product Service and an Order Service, might interact using RESTful principles.

### Example Scenario:

**1. Product Service:**

- Exposes an endpoint to retrieve product information.
- HTTP GET Request: `/products/{productId}`
- Response: `{ "productId": "123", "productName": "Example Product", "price": 49.99 }`

**2. Order Service:**

- Initiates an order creation by fetching product details from the Product Service.
- HTTP GET Request: `/products/123`
- Response: `{ "productId": "123", "productName": "Example Product", "price": 49.99 }`
- Uses the received product details to create an order.
- HTTP POST Request: `/orders`
- Request Body: `{ "productId": "123", "quantity": 2 }`
- Response: `{ "orderId": "456", "total": 99.98, "status": "Pending" }`

In this example, the Order Service interacts with the Product Service by making RESTful HTTP requests to obtain product information. The communication is stateless, with each request containing the necessary information, and responses conveying the results of the operation. RESTful principles emphasize simplicity, scalability, and uniformity, making them well-suited for microservices communication.
