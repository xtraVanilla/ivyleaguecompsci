### what are sagas?

Sagas in microservices architecture are a design pattern for managing distributed transactions, offering an alternative to traditional two-phase commit protocols. They are particularly useful in scenarios where a business operation involves multiple services, each with its own database. Sagas facilitate the coordination of these distributed transactions by breaking them into a series of smaller, independent steps, allowing for more flexible error handling and better overall system resilience.
