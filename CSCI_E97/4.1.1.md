### what are sagas?

Sagas in microservices architecture are like choreographers for distributed transactions, replacing the rigid structure of traditional two-phase commit protocols. Imagine a business ballet spanning multiple services, each with its own backstage of data. Sagas bring order to this complex dance by breaking down the grand performance into smaller, independent acts. This not only allows for nimble error handling but also enhances the system's overall resilience, creating a more graceful and fault-tolerant dance of transactions.
