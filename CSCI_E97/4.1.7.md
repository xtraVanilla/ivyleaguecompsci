In the context of the Saga pattern, the rollback mechanism is achieved through a series of compensating actions. Let's break down the concept:

1. **Compensating Actions:**

   - Compensating actions are specific actions designed to undo or compensate for the effects of previously executed steps in a saga.
   - These actions are defined to handle specific failure scenarios or business errors and are invoked when needed to bring the system back to a consistent state.

2. **Example in the TypeScript Implementation:**

   - In the TypeScript implementation of the Saga pattern example, the `OrderSaga` class defines a method called `compensateOrderCreation`. This method serves as the compensating action for the order creation saga.

   ```typescript
   private async compensateOrderCreation(order: Order): Promise<void> {
       // Logic for compensating action
       await this.publishCompensateOrderCreation(order);
   }
   ```

3. **Publishing Compensating Events:**

   - The compensating action often involves publishing compensating events to notify other services about the need to reverse or compensate for a particular operation.
   - In the example, the `publishCompensateOrderCreation` method is responsible for publishing a compensating event related to order creation.

   ```typescript
   private async publishCompensateOrderCreation(order: Order): Promise<void> {
       // Logic for publishing compensating event
       await this.rabbitMQService.publishCompensateOrderCreation(order.id);
   }
   ```

4. **Handling Compensating Events:**

   - The `RabbitMQService` class includes a method called `subscribeToCompensateOrderCreationEvent` to handle compensating events received from the message broker.
   - This method triggers the compensating action specific to the order creation process.

   ```typescript
   async subscribeToCompensateOrderCreationEvent(orderId: string): Promise<void> {
       // Logic for handling compensating event and triggering compensating action
   }
   ```

5. **Compensating Action Logic:**

   - The logic inside the `subscribeToCompensateOrderCreationEvent` method implements the actual compensating actions. It undoes the effects of the original actions related to order creation.

   ```typescript
   async subscribeToCompensateOrderCreationEvent(orderId: string): Promise<void> {
       // Logic to compensate for the order creation
   }
   ```

By following this approach, the saga pattern allows for graceful handling of errors or failures by initiating compensating actions. The compensating actions are specifically designed to counteract the effects of the original actions, ensuring that the system can recover to a consistent state even after encountering issues.
