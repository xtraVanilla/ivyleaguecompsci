### The Aggregator Pattern

The Aggregator Pattern in microservices design is a crucial approach when dealing with complex systems and dependencies between services. This pattern involves creating a service that receives a request, makes multiple requests to different services, combines the results, and responds to the initial request. This article illustrates the Aggregator Pattern using a practical use case at Mercantile Finance, a global financial services firm.

### Use Case: Mercantile Finance Employee Management System

Mercantile Finance, transitioning from a monolithic to a microservices architecture, has outsourced its vast and complex employee management system. As part of the microservices implementation using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), four services are identified:

1. **Service 1: get personal information.**
2. **Service 2: get leave information.**
3. **Service 3: get employee performance information.**
4. **Service 4: get allocation information (project and work allocation).**

### Problem Scenario

Two existing consumer services, the attendance management system and project management system, require information not provided by the individual services. For example:

- The attendance system lacks services for personal information and leave information.
- The project management system lacks services for personal information and allocation information.

### Aggregator Pattern Solutions

1. **Parallel Aggregation (Scatter-Gather Pattern):**

   - In this scenario, requests are sent to necessary services in parallel.
   - The attendance service sends parallel calls to personal information and leave information services, aggregates the responses, and sends them back to the attendance service.

2. **Chain Pattern (Service Chaining):**

   - Requests are not sent to services in parallel, but rather sequentially, forming a chain.
   - Useful when one service has a dependency on another.
   - For instance, the leave system, which uses employee code instead of ID, first invokes personal information service, obtains the employee code, and then uses it to fetch leave information.

3. **Branch Aggregation:**
   - Based on a factor (e.g., branch code), a decision is made on where the service should go next.
   - Use case: A service receives user ID and branch code, and based on the branch code, decides whether to route the request to sales information service or technology information service.

### Advantages of Aggregator Pattern:

- **Flexibility for Requirements:**

  - Easy adaptation to changes in business logic.
  - Example: Introducing a new aggregation service without modifying existing ones for a changed requirement.

- **Efficient Authorization and Authentication Flow:**
  - Careful consideration of how authorization and authentication flow through aggregated services is essential.
  - Suggestion: Implement a separate identity management service and redirect traffic through it to optimize token validation.

### Conclusion:

The Aggregator Pattern provides a flexible and efficient solution for managing dependencies between microservices. It enables the composition of responses from multiple services, ensuring that consumers receive the necessary information without burdening individual services with unnecessary functionalities. The use cases presented in the article demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the Aggregator Pattern in real-world microservices architectures.
