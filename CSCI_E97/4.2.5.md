### quota cache

A "quota cache" typically refers to a caching mechanism used to store and manage quotas. Quotas are limits set on the usage of resources or services within a system. For example, you might have a quota on the number of requests a user can make, the amount of data they can store, or the frequency of certain operations.

The quota cache helps efficiently track and enforce these limits. It can store information about usage, remaining quotas, and relevant timestamps.
