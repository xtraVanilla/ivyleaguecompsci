### orchestration

In the realm of microservices and distributed systems, orchestration is the maestro that conducts the symphony of services. Like a masterful conductor guiding a diverse orchestra, orchestration coordinates the flow of activities across multiple services to achieve a harmonious and synchronized performance. This central direction ensures that each service plays its part at the right time and in the right sequence, creating a cohesive and well-orchestrated composition of distributed processes.
