### transactions

In the realm of computing, distributed transactions are like managing a grand symphony spread across multiple stages. In the cozy world of monolithic applications, transactions dance solo, ensuring that all moves in the act succeed or none take the spotlight. But in the sprawling landscapes of distributed systems, hitting that harmony gets tricky. With networks playing the diva, latency throwing a curveball, and the quest for consistency among varied databases, it's a real challenge. Distributed transactions step up to the plate, aiming to spread the same rulebook (ACID properties) across these diverse components, making sure the show goes on seamlessly despite the distributed chaos.
