### transactions

Distributed transactions involve coordinating and managing transactions that span multiple databases or services in a distributed system. Traditional transactions (such as those in a monolithic application) typically rely on a single database, ensuring that either all operations within the transaction succeed or none of them take effect. In a distributed environment, achieving this level of coordination becomes challenging due to issues like network failures, latency, and the need for maintaining consistency across diverse data stores. Distributed transactions aim to extend transactional guarantees across multiple, potentially independent components, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) despite the challenges of a distributed architecture.
