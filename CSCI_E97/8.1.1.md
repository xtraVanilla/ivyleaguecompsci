### consumer-driven contract test

Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (CDCT) is a testing approach that involves collaboration between service providers and consumers to ensure that the interactions between them are mutually understood and remain consistent over time. This pattern helps identify and prevent issues that may arise from changes made by either party.

In CDCT, consumers define the contracts (expectations) for the services they rely on, and providers ensure that they meet these contracts. This helps in achieving compatibility and preventing unintentional breaking changes.

Here's an example of Consumer-Driven Contract Testing using TypeScript and a testing library like Jest:

### Consumer Side:

```typescript
// Consumer contract test
import { Pact } from "@pact-foundation/pact";
import { like } from "@pact-foundation/pact/dsl/matchers";
import { getPerson } from "./consumer";

const { Matchers } = Pact;

describe("Person API", () => {
  const personId = "123";

  it("should successfully get a person", async () => {
    return new Pact({
      consumer: "Consumer",
      provider: "Provider",
    })
      .uponReceiving("a request to get a person")
      .withRequest({
        method: "GET",
        path: `/person/${personId}`,
      })
      .willRespondWith({
        status: 200,
        body: like({
          id: personId,
          name: "John Doe",
          age: 30,
        }),
      })
      .verify(getPerson(personId));
  });
});
```

In this example, the consumer defines a contract test for the `getPerson` function. It specifies the expected request and the response using the Pact library.

### Provider Side:

```typescript
// Provider contract test
import { Verifier } from "@pact-foundation/pact";
import path from "path";

describe("Pact Verification", () => {
  it("should validate the expectations of the consumer", async () => {
    await new Verifier().verifyProvider({
      provider: "Provider",
      pactUrls: [path.resolve(process.cwd(), "pacts/consumer-provider.json")],
      // Add other verification options as needed
    });
  });
});
```

On the provider side, the `Verifier` from the Pact library is used to verify that the provider meets the expectations defined by the consumer. It reads the contract file generated by the consumer and performs the verification.

These tests can be part of your continuous integration process to ensure that changes made by either the consumer or provider do not break the agreed-upon contracts.

This example uses the Pact library for simplicity, but there are other tools and frameworks available for consumer-driven contract testing in different languages and ecosystems.
