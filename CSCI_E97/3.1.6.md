### Using Service Discovery

In a microservices architecture, Service Discovery plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between services. Service Discovery enables services to dynamically discover and locate each other without relying on hard-coded endpoints. Let's explore how TypeScript microservices can utilize Service Discovery using a hypothetical scenario of an order service discovering a payment service.

Assuming you have a Service Discovery mechanism in place (e.g., Consul, Eureka), here's a TypeScript example:

```typescript
// Sample Service Discovery Client (replace with the actual library you're using)
import { ServiceDiscoveryClient } from "your-service-discovery-library";

class OrderService {
  private serviceDiscovery: ServiceDiscoveryClient;

  constructor() {
    // Initialize the Service Discovery client
    this.serviceDiscovery = new ServiceDiscoveryClient();
  }

  // Method to place an order and discover the payment service
  public async placeOrder(orderId: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
      // Use Service Discovery to get the endpoint of the payment service
      const paymentServiceEndpoint = await this.serviceDiscovery.discover(
        "payment-service"
      );

      // Make a request to the discovered payment service endpoint
      const paymentResult = await this.callPaymentService(
        paymentServiceEndpoint,
        orderId
      );

      return `Order ${orderId} placed. ${paymentResult}`;
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors related to Service Discovery or payment service communication
      return `Order ${orderId} placement failed. ${error.message}`;
    }
  }

  // Simulated method representing the communication with the payment service
  private async callPaymentService(
    endpoint: string,
    orderId: string
  ): Promise<string> {
    // Make an HTTP request to the payment service using the discovered endpoint
    // Replace this with your actual HTTP client implementation
    // For example, using Axios or the 'node-fetch' library
    // This is a simplified example, actual implementation will depend on your service communication protocol
    const response = await fetch(`${endpoint}/pay`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ orderId }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      return `Payment successful for order ${orderId}`;
    } else {
      // Handle payment service errors
      throw new Error(`Payment failed for order ${orderId}`);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const orderService = new OrderService();
const orderId = "order-123";

orderService
  .placeOrder(orderId)
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((error) => console.error(`Order placement failed: ${error.message}`));
```

In this example, the `OrderService` class uses a Service Discovery client to dynamically discover the endpoint of the payment service. The `placeOrder` method then makes a request to the discovered payment service endpoint. The actual Service Discovery implementation details may vary based on the library or tool you choose.

This approach enhances flexibility and scalability in a microservices environment by allowing services to adapt to changes in the network and infrastructure dynamically.
