### pool architecture

Pool Architecture is a design approach where each client in a system is allocated its dedicated monolithic instance, offering tailored infrastructure and scalability. This model contrasts with traditional microservices and aims to address challenges related to varying client traffic. Each client operates within its designated "pool," allowing for resource optimization, incident isolation, enhanced security, and simplified deployment, though it requires careful consideration of code maintenance and potential initial costs.
