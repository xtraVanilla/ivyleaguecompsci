### strangler application

The Strangler Application pattern is a technique for migrating from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture gradually. The idea is to replace specific functionalities or components of the existing monolith with microservices over time. This helps in minimizing risks and allows for a smooth transition.

Here's a TypeScript example to illustrate the Strangler Application pattern:

Assume we have a monolithic application with functionality related to order processing. The goal is to gradually migrate order-related functionality to microservices.

1. **Monolithic Application (Initial State):**

```typescript
// Monolithic OrderService in the existing application
class MonolithicOrderService {
  processOrder(orderId: string): string {
    // Business logic to process the order
    return `Order processed successfully for ID: ${orderId}`;
  }
}
```

2. **Strangler Application (Introducing Microservices):**

```typescript
// Microservice for order processing
class OrderProcessingMicroservice {
  processOrder(orderId: string): string {
    // Business logic specific to the microservice
    return `Microservice: Order processed successfully for ID: ${orderId}`;
  }
}

// StranglerApplication orchestrates the transition
class StranglerApplication {
  private monolithicOrderService: MonolithicOrderService;
  private orderProcessingMicroservice: OrderProcessingMicroservice;

  constructor() {
    this.monolithicOrderService = new MonolithicOrderService();
    this.orderProcessingMicroservice = new OrderProcessingMicroservice();
  }

  // The new method that gradually migrates functionality to the microservice
  processOrder(orderId: string): string {
    // New orders will be processed by the microservice
    if (orderId.startsWith("newOrder")) {
      return this.orderProcessingMicroservice.processOrder(orderId);
    }

    // Old orders will be processed by the existing monolith
    return this.monolithicOrderService.processOrder(orderId);
  }
}

// Example Usage
const stranglerApp = new StranglerApplication();

console.log(stranglerApp.processOrder("newOrder123")); // Microservice: Order processed successfully for ID: newOrder123
console.log(stranglerApp.processOrder("legacyOrder456")); // Order processed successfully for ID: legacyOrder456 (via monolith)
```

In this example:

- The `MonolithicOrderService` represents the initial state of the monolithic application.
- The `OrderProcessingMicroservice` is introduced as a microservice handling new orders.
- The `StranglerApplication` class orchestrates the transition. It checks the order ID, and if it starts with a specific prefix (e.g., "newOrder"), it routes the request to the microservice; otherwise, it processes it using the existing monolith.

This way, the application gradually transitions from the monolithic approach to a microservices architecture by introducing new services while still utilizing the existing monolith for certain functionalities. Over time, more functionalities can be migrated to dedicated microservices until the monolith is fully "strangled" or replaced.
