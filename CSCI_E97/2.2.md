### decompose by sub-domain pattern

When applying the Decompose by Sub-Domain pattern, the project structure is organized around distinct sub-domains within the business. Here's an example for an e-commerce system:

```plaintext
ecommerce-system/
|-- src/
|   |-- sales/
|   |   |-- order-service/
|   |   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |   |-- services/
|   |   |   |-- models/
|   |   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |   |-- order-service.ts
|   |   |
|   |   |-- customer-service/
|   |   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |   |-- services/
|   |   |   |-- models/
|   |   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |   |-- customer-service.ts
|
|   |-- inventory/
|   |   |-- product-service/
|   |   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |   |-- services/
|   |   |   |-- models/
|   |   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |   |-- product-service.ts
|
|   |-- billing/
|   |   |-- payment-service/
|   |   |   |-- controllers/
|   |   |   |-- services/
|   |   |   |-- models/
|   |   |   |-- repositories/
|   |   |   |-- api-routes.ts
|   |   |   |-- payment-service.ts
|
|-- shared/
|   |-- common-utils/
|   |-- models/
|   |-- repositories/
|
|-- tests/
|-- config/
|-- scripts/
|-- dist/
|-- node_modules/
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- README.md
```

In this example:

- Each sub-domain (sales, inventory, billing) is represented by a separate directory (`sales`, `inventory`, `billing`).
- Inside each sub-domain, there are individual services (`order-service`, `customer-service`, `product-service`, `payment-service`) that handle specific aspects of the sub-domain.
- Shared code, such as common utilities, models, and repositories, is still placed in the `shared` directory to be reused as needed.
- The structure allows for a more modular organization, where each sub-domain can be developed and maintained independently, promoting better separation of concerns.

This approach is beneficial when the business can be naturally divided into distinct sub-domains, each requiring its own set of services. It helps to align development teams with specific business areas, making it easier to manage and evolve the system.
