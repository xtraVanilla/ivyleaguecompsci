### api composition

API Composition is a query pattern that involves aggregating data from multiple services to fulfill a client's request. It allows clients to request specific pieces of data or functionality by composing them from various microservices, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. Below is a TypeScript example illustrating API Composition:

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import axios from "axios";

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/user/:userId", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const userId = req.params.userId;

    // Fetch user details from User Service
    const userResponse = await axios.get(`http://user-service/users/${userId}`);
    const user = userResponse.data;

    // Fetch user's orders from Order Service
    const ordersResponse = await axios.get(
      `http://order-service/orders?userId=${userId}`
    );
    const orders = ordersResponse.data;

    // Combine user details and orders
    const result = {
      user,
      orders,
    };

    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example:

- The Express server listens for a GET request at the endpoint `/user/:userId`, where `:userId` is a dynamic parameter representing the user's ID.
- When a request is received, the server fetches user details from the User Service and orders from the Order Service using Axios, a popular HTTP client for Node.js.
- The fetched data is then combined into a single result object, which includes both user details and their orders.
- The server responds with the aggregated result.

This pattern is beneficial when different microservices manage distinct pieces of data, and clients need to aggregate information from multiple sources. It allows for more granular data retrieval and minimizes the data transferred over the network, optimizing performance. However, it requires careful consideration of potential issues such as increased latency due to multiple requests and the need for proper error handling.
