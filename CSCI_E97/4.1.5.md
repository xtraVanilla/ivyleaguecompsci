### choreography

Choreography, in microservices, means services communicate by broadcasting events or messages without a central controller. Each service decides its actions based on received events, promoting decentralization and flexibility. This approach, unlike orchestration, enables services to evolve independently and is often used with the Saga pattern for handling distributed transactions.

In the TypeScript implementation of the Saga pattern example, choreography is implemented through the use of a message broker, specifically RabbitMQ. Let's break down the key components and steps involved in implementing choreography:

1. **Message Broker Setup (RabbitMQ):**

   - A dedicated directory, `rabbitmq/`, is created to house the RabbitMQ-related code.
   - `rabbitmq.config.ts` contains the configuration settings for RabbitMQ, including connection details.
   - `rabbitmq.service.ts` encapsulates the functionality related to interacting with RabbitMQ, such as establishing a connection, creating channels, and handling message-related operations.

2. **OrderSaga and Event Handling:**

   - The `OrderSaga` class serves as the orchestrator for the saga and subscribes to events published on the message broker.
   - In the `execute` method of `OrderSaga`, after publishing the order created event, it waits for external events (e.g., order processed event) by listening for messages from the message broker.

   ```typescript
   private async execute(order: Order): Promise<void> {
       // Publish order created event
       await this.publishOrderCreatedEvent(order);

       // Wait for external events (choreography)
       await this.waitForOrderProcessedEvent(order);
   }
   ```

3. **Event Subscription (Choreography):**

   - The `waitForOrderProcessedEvent` method is responsible for subscribing to the order processed event on the message broker. This method uses the RabbitMQ service to establish a connection, create a channel, and consume messages.

   ```typescript
   private async waitForOrderProcessedEvent(order: Order): Promise<void> {
       // Logic for subscribing to order processed event
       await this.rabbitMQService.subscribeToOrderProcessedEvent(order.id);
   }
   ```

4. **Message Processing:**

   - The actual logic for processing messages received from the message broker is encapsulated within the `subscribeToOrderProcessedEvent` method in `rabbitmq.service.ts`. This method handles the consumption of messages related to the order processed event.

   ```typescript
   async subscribeToOrderProcessedEvent(orderId: string): Promise<void> {
       // Logic for subscribing to and processing order processed event
   }
   ```

By structuring the code in this way, you establish a choreographed communication pattern where services communicate indirectly through events on the message broker. The `OrderSaga` class subscribes to relevant events, allowing it to react to changes in the system and progress the saga accordingly.
