### choreography

Choreography, in microservices, means services communicate by broadcasting events or messages without a central controller. Each service decides its actions based on received events, promoting decentralization and flexibility. This approach, unlike orchestration, enables services to evolve independently and is often used with the Saga pattern for handling distributed transactions.
