### choreography

Choreography, in microservices, means services communicate by broadcasting events or messages without a central controller. Each service decides its actions based on received events, promoting decentralization and flexibility. This approach, unlike orchestration, enables services to evolve independently and is often used with the Saga pattern for handling distributed transactions.

In the TypeScript implementation for our Saga pattern example, the OrderSaga class serves as the orchestrator. It defines the sequence of steps involved in creating an order and coordinates the interactions between the OrderService and external services. The execute method in the OrderSaga class encapsulates the orchestration logic, ensuring that each step is executed in the desired order.
